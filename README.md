A Prime number calculator

This calculator was created to help me understand the logic of how to prove a number as Prime.
It was kind of done backwards as the intent was to write a flow chart and psuedo code for an assignment!
The problem is that i didnt understand the math and the best way for me to understand it was to write an algorithm to do it for me !!
So here it is.

Things to note... The algortihm currently uses the square root of 10 as a condition to break a while loop which holds the iteration that deletes 
multiples of the first elements of an array apart from themselves. The program has however been written so that if we change this small bit of logic
then we can actually input any number which will be the last number in an array from 2 and all prime numbers up to that number should be listed as well as the original array.

The code is commented explaining what im doing at each step. If anyone finds any gaps in the logic please do hit me up!! i think i have it nailed though 
and finally understand prime numbers :D haha go me !!
